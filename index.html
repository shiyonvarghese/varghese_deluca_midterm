Cats

Low Maintenance: Cats are known for their self-sufficiency. They clean themselves, use a litter box, and require minimal grooming.

Independent: Cats don't need constant attention and can be left alone for longer periods, making them a great choice for people with busy schedules.

Quiet and Clean: Cats are generally quiet animals, and they are less likely to disturb neighbors. They are also meticulous about cleanliness and grooming, reducing the need for baths.

Space-Efficient: Cats are well-suited for small living spaces, such as apartments, and they don't need a yard to run around in.

Pest Control: Many cats have strong hunting instincts and can help keep your home free of unwanted pests like mice and insects.
